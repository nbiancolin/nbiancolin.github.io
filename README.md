## About Me
Hi! I'm Nicholas Biancolin, an incoming Third Year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I am a motivated self starter, who is able to function independently and in teams to accomplish tasks on time and to high quality. I am dependable and will try my best to do an excellent job.  I hope to gain skills and work experience while making a positive impac

## Projects
- [**Wiki Updater**](https://github.com/nbiancolin/wiki-updater)
  - Wrote a collection of python scripts to update our team's DokuWiki (progress tracking WIKI for the course ECE297).
  Also wrote a [**custom API**](https://github.com/nbiancolin/dokuwiki-https) to interface with the wiki **over HTTPS**, thereby not being succeptible to the security risks from XML-RPC.
- [**Galaxy Jar**](./GalaxyJar/)
  - Developed and built capacitive touch sensors connected to Arduino Nano ESP8266 boards using Wi-Fi to connect to a web server, allowing the Arduinos to communicate with each other.
- [**Risk**](https://github.com/ericliu4/ECE243-Risk)
  - Implemented the game "Risk" written in C and Assembly, to be run on a DE1-SOC FPGA, displaying video and audio, and taking input from a PS-2 keyboard.
  - Also wrote a [**custom API**](https://github.com/nbiancolin/DE1SOC-VideoApi) to assist drawing to the VGA video display.
- [**Web Scavenger Hunt**](./Christmas2024)
  - Built a polar coordinates sketching function that draws a percentage of a certain graph (as described by a cookie stored in the user's browser). This cookie is updated when tasks are completed in other webpages.
- [**Whack an Engineer**](https://github.com/nbiancolin/whack-an-engineer)
  - An engineer themed 'Whack a Mole' game built using only Verilog, to be run on a DE1-SOC FPGA board.


- **More in the works, stay tuned**
